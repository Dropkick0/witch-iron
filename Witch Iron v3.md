What’s an RPG?
Just kidding, this is not your first TTRPG, if you have somehow stumbled onto this and you don’t know what tabletop roleplaying is, you should play whatever game your group enjoys.
If you don’t have a group or preferred game, I recommend **Into the Odd, Knave** or **Mothership**.
## What this Game is
This is a game about building a legacy.
This is a game about consequence and change.
This is a game to be ripped apart and reused.
## What this is Not
This is not a rules light game.
This is not a strict narrative game.
This is not here to waste your time.

## 
Descendent** Creation**
The gods are cruel, and danger is everywhere. Here are the four steps for creating a Descendent. It is recommended to roll your next Descendent as well.
**Step 1: **Roll **Ability Scores.** Roll **d20** **ten times**; then assign to any ability requiring a **d20**.
**Step 2: **Gain three Genetic Traits.
**Step** **3:** ****Select** **two** ****Lineages****** **available** **to** **your** **line,**** **and** **add** ****+10%**** **to** **every** **listed** **Ability** **Score** **from** **each** **of** **your** ****Lineages**.
**Step 4: **Gather starting **Trappings**.
### **Luck**
The fates are capricious, callous. **Luck** is spent in the two following ways:
**Modify Rolls: **After a **Check **is rolled, you may spend it at a **one-to-one** ratio to raise or lower your roll. However, you can no longer **Critically Hit** or **Fumble** from **Doubles **on this roll.
**Save from Death: **You may spend **3****0 Luck** to safely survive any situation.
**Luck** Checks may be rolled to decide random events. At the **end of every session**, you gain a d10 **Luck**.
### Maximum Encumbrance
Your back is killing you and your limbs are slow. When you **exceed** your **Max Encumbrance** in carried items, you suffer the following effects.
**Past 1x Enc:** 1/2 Speed, -20% to all Checks.
**Past 2x Enc:** No Speed, -40% to all Checks.
### Instant Access Items
You pull the dagger out of its sheath with a swift motion, before driving it into their eye socket. You may **wield** these items **without** using an **action**.
### Magick / Faith
The Gods feed on your Magick, and will not give it back. You may **only** have **one** of these two Scores.

## Passing Genes
The laws of nature are written in runes of flesh and blood. For the first **Descendant** in a Line of Lineage or when a **Descendant** is indirectly related, roll **three** **Genetic Traits** (rerolling duplicates) and record these in order in Genetic Trait **slots 1, 2 **& **3**.
A Descendant has a **50% chance** of gaining their **Progenitor’s** Genetic Trait for **slots 1, 2 **&** 3**. Otherwise, roll a random Genetic Trait for that slot.
When rolling for a Genetic Trait, check if the roll is even or odd. When **even,** gain the **Base Trait**, and when **odd,** gain the **Duality Trait.**
Step 3: Lines of **Lineage**
The group’s **Line of Lineage** begins with **two** of the following Lineages unlocked, for each player.
Then** **select** ****two** **Lineages**** **for** **your** **Descendant,** **adding** ****+10%**** **to** **each** **listed** **Ability** **Score** **from** **both** **of** **your** **Lineages.

### **Writing Your Book of Bones**
Starting with the death of your first Descendant in a Line of Lineage, record their name and create a Title befitting their legacy (or lack thereof).
Your next Descendant enters into play** as soon as possible; **you do not have to know the exact family dynamic, they may be previously an unknown sibling or cousin if you cannot justify them being your child.

# Witch Iron
Witch Iron is the rarest and most cursed of all arcane materials, a living shard of an ancient force bound in an endless, paradox prison known only as The Sleeper. Birthed from the Void, it shimmers with an unearthly beauty, its surface writhing with fleeting shapes. Those who hold it hear faint, alien whispers.
### How to Find
Witch Iron doesn’t wait to be discovered; it chooses those who will wield it, often at times of desperation. It is up to the GM exactly when/where Raw Witch Iron will appear but here are some suggestions:
**Predetermined:** Such as at the bottom of a dungeon, or one the back of a foretold meteor.
**Timing:** Beginning of the campaign, arrival to a new land, after each player loses their first Descendant or after reaching Tier 8.
**Random:** Miraculously appears whenever a Descendant rolls 100 on a Check.
### How to Use
Raw Witch Iron can be used to extend life or bring death. It can transfer the **lifespan** from one person to another, with the donor dying and the receiver increasing their **Lifespan** by **d10**** years **for every decade left in the donor's natural **lifespan**. However, this use is not without its risks and the receiver will suffer **one **Corruption****, and then **double **their current **Corruption**, each time.
Alternatively, each Lineage has a specific **Artifact** that Witch Iron will evolve into, shaped by the wielder’s soul and experiences. The process unfolds **one session** at a time, and the artifact grows stronger as it consumes more of the wielder’s humanity.
The wielder must decide if they will complete the transformation or cast the shard aside.
If the process reaches its final stage, the artifact becomes permanent—but the wielder’s humanity is lost, and their** Line of Lineage** is lost forever.

*Valedictorian the Voracious, the scholarly sage of countless languages and forbidden lores. Unraveling an ancient summoning rite, he conjured a demon of knowledge from the Void. Struck a bargain for unending wisdom, glossing over the subtle clause: his life was the price. As the eldritch entity force-fed the secrets of the universe into his psyche, **Valedictorian's** mind was overstretched to the breaking point. Consumed by a celestial overload, his last utterance echoed in every language: "Just As Planned...". Alas, a scholar undone by his own insatiable curiosity!*

Additionally, your body is covered with primal spiked armor, pulsing with dark energy and voidlight. You may not wear any other armor or clothing, but you gain **AV** equal to half of your **MB + RB** (rounded down) to all body parts, which fully repairs itself after a night's rest.

| Hits | Example                                                                                       |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Drag and throw a heavy object with reach.                                                     |
| 2    | Grapple an enemy & pin them to the ground.                                                    |
| 3    | Use the chains to attack with this Check, dealing MBx2+RB damage to all within 60ft.          |
| 4    | Use the chains as a shield, catching the next attack with equal or less Hits than this check. |

**Stage 3:** The Witch Iron chains fully transform, their weight fusing into your very form. Your transformation is complete, granting you the ability to become a hulking Chain Demon with **Hit Dice** equal to** twice** your **Tier **for a **RB x 10 minutes**. In this form, you have unparalleled strength, your attacks deal **additional damage **equal to your **MB**, and you have a reach of **60ft.** However, each time you transform, suffer **d6 Corruption**.
Additionally, your body is covered with thick, constantly shifting chains over eldritch armor. The chains coil and writhe ceaselessly. You may not wear any other armor or clothing, but you gain **AV** equal to half of your **MB + RB** (rounded down) to all body parts, which fully repairs itself after a night's rest.
You are no longer human, and the** Line of Workhorses is at an end.** Only death can cut your connection to the chains.

Conflict Resolution
There are three main methods of resolving conflicts.
**Whatever’s Reasonable**: If a conflict does not have a meaningful consequence or the solution would reasonably work, then don’t roll; it just works.
**Ability **or** Skill Check**: If a conflict has a binary outcome or brevity is desired, make a Check, possibly modified by the situation.
**Quarrel**: If a conflict has many possible outcomes or a detailed outcome is desired, make a **Quarrel**.
### Dice Terminology
**+Hits**: After succeeding on a Check, add that number of Hits to your total.
**Doubles: **Rolling the same number for the units and tens dice.
****E**xploding****E****: **When you roll the maximum result on a die, roll it again and use the total.
**Reverse:** Swaps the tens and units die before roll modifications from Luck**.**
### Scope of Checks
When you make a Check, use whatever the result is for all related checks until the situation meaningfully changes**.** Basically, you should only **roll once for a given Check **(i**.**e**.**, Picking a Lock, you either pick it or you can’t)**.**
There are some obvious exceptions to this rule, for example, combat.
### Player Agency
After a Check that fails, the player should be given the choice of at least two potential outcomes (I.e., vs. Picking a Lock, failure: I can’t pick this lock, or I can but I alert enemies).
Checks
You succeed on a Check by rolling percentile dice (d100 or 2d10) using one for the ten’s die and the other for the unit’s die****,**** equal to or under an Ability; if you roll over****,**** you fail.**
****
****S****uccess:** Use the result of the tens die as your number of ****Hits** on success**. **S**o****,**** if you passed a check with a roll of 42****,**** you score **+4 **Hits**. ******
****
**F****ailure:** **S**ubtract the result of the tens die from the tens unit of your Ability **S**core as your number of **Hits**. **S**o****,**** if you failed a Melee Check with a roll of 63 and had a Muscle **S**core of 56****,**** you scored** -**1 Hit**.****
****
****Critical Hit: **If you roll **01-05 **or **Doubles** on a **S**uccessful Check****,**** you score +6 **Hits** as your roll or gain** +**1 Hit**** to your total (whichever is higher).****
****
**F**umble: If you roll **96-100 **or **Doubles** on a Failed Check****,**** you score -6 **Hits** as your roll or suffer -**1 Hit** to your total (whichever is lower).
### -Difficulty Scale-
| Difficulty | Modifier |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Very Easy  | +40%     |
| Easy       | +20%     |
| Normal     | +0%      |
| Hard       | -20%     |
| Very Hard  | -40%     |

### Advanced Checks
If you would like a more detailed approach to Checks you can use the following change:
**S****uccess:**  **S**ubtract the result of the tens die from the tens unit of your Ability **S**core as your number of **Hits****. ****S**o, if you passed a Ranged Check with a 09 and had a Quickness **S**core of 61, you scored +6 **Hits**.
Quarrels
A system to resolve conflicts quickly. This can be any dispute,** such as** bartering, preventing a wolf attack, finding a new contact, interrogation, swaying an audience, manipulation, chases, or even full battles.
**Agree to Terms,** 
“If I win, you'll do ... If you win, I'll do...“
**Make a Contested Check**
**Resolve or Compromise**
**Net Hits: -1 or Less, **Failure
**Net Hits: +0, **Victory at a Cost
**Net Hits: +1 or More, **Victory
#### LingeringL Quarrels
If a ****Quarrel**** is Lingering, record its name & **Hits**. It will then instigate a ****Quarrel**** at set intervals.
| Lingering      | Set Interval         | Removed By:                  |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Disease        | Each Night.          | Defeating in a Quarrel, Cure |
| Need Deprived* | After Time Interval. | Fulfilling Needs             |

*Also escalates by **+2 Hits** at each interval.
#### Scope of Quarrels
When making a Quarrel, use whatever the result is for all related checks until the situation changes**.** You should only **roll once for a given Quarrel **(i**.**e**.**, vs**.** Cliff, climbing all the way up and not just one part)**.**
#### Player Agency
After losing a Quarrel, the player should always be given the choice of at least two potential outcomes (I.e., vs. Cliff on a -2 Hits the choice between, suffering a Severity 2 Injury, or losing their sword).
#### Group Quarrels
When a group is involved in a **Quarrel,** you have two ways of resolving it.
**One Descendant** makes a Check for the group.
**Each Descendant** in the group individually Checks against a single opposed Check.
## Compromise Examples
Here are examples to **help** you adjudicate Quarrels. **Don’t take these as hard rules; make them your own.**

Advanced Travel
Traveling is a challenging endeavor. The wilderness is fraught with dangers, and even the most prepared travelers can find themselves facing unexpected threats. Here are some advanced Travel rules, **feel free to ignore or rewrite them to suit your game.**
### Travel Options
Different modes of travel can affect the difficulty of navigation and the chance of encounters.
| Travel By | Navigation    | Encounters        |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| On Foot   | No Change     | No Change         |
| Mounted   | 1 Hit Easier  | One Less Check    |
| Coach     | 2 Hits Easier | Two Less Checks   |
| Ship      | 3 Hits Easier | Three Less Checks |

### Navigation
The difficulty of navigating a journey is represented by a **Quarrel.** The longer the journey, the more **Hits **are required to successfully navigate it.
When **On Foot **or** Mounted **everyone must make this **Quarrel, **for themselves.
If aboard a** Coach** or **Ship** the pilot makes this **Quarrel,** affecting everyone.
| Journey Length  | vs Quarrel Hits           | vs Quarrel Hits       |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1-7 Days        | 2                         | 2                     |

| Suffer Fatigue  | +Two Fatigue              | +Four Fatigue         |

***The Player** chooses when** Compromising.**
### Rations
Traveling requires sustenance. This depends on the length of the journey and the size of the creature.
| Size     | Days | Weeks | Months |
| -------- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| Tiny     | 1    | 2     | 4      |
| Small    | 2    | 4     | 8      |
| Medium   | 4    | 8     | 16     |

| Huge     | 16   | 32    | 64     |
| Gigantic | 32   | 64    | 128    |

***Rations **cost **five silver** and weigh **one Enc **for **two**.
**Double requirement **if you need to** buy water.**
### Diseases
If a creature does not have enough rations, they must make a **Hardship Quarrel** to avoid suffering from diseases. The severity of the disease depends on the amount of rations they are short.
| Short | Disease                                 |
| ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1-2   | Gravelhack, Lingering Quarrel vs 2 Hits |
| 3-4   | Dysentery, Lingering Quarrel vs 4 Hits  |
| 5+    | Rotfever, Lingering Quarrel vs 6 Hits*  |

***Initial Quarrel** gains **+2 Hits**, every **5 rations** short.
### Encounters
The chance of encountering a threat during the journey is determined by a **+40% Luck Check**. The Descendant with the **highest Luck** makes the Check. If the Check fails, an encounter occurs.
| Journey Length | Encounter Checks* |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| 1-7 Days       | One Check         |
| 1-4 Weeks      | Two Checks        |
| 1-12 Months    | Three Checks      |

***Doubled **if the party is **Encumbered.**
Advanced Contacts
Here are some advanced Contacts rules, **feel free to ignore or rewrite them to suit your game.**
### Finding Contacts
Your ability to find contacts depends on your Tier. You can use a relevant skill to find these contacts. The difficulty of the **Quarrel** is adjusted based on the quality of the contact you're trying to find.
| Tier | Contact Quality | Vs Quarrel Hits |
| ---- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 0-2  | Adept           | 2               |
| 3-5  | Professional    | 4               |
| 6+   | Master          | 6               |

### Modifiers
Finding a Contact at a baseline takes **one week** and has a** silver cost** of **one favor** to find a Contact. This can be modified using the following examples:
| Modifier       | One Hit Easier         | One Hit Harder        |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Reputation     | Beloved                | Hated                 |
| Affiliation    | Likely to Know         | Long Shot             |
| Time           | One Month              | Right Now             |
| Spending       | Double                 | None                  |
| Compromises*   | Victory at a Cost (+0) | Failure (-1 or Lower) |
| Increased Cost | d6 Favors              | 2d6 Favors            |
| Suffer Stress  | +One Stress            | +Two Stress           |

***The Player** chooses when** Compromising.**
### Favors
Once you've established a Contact, you can ask them for **favor**s. Each **favor** is equivalent to a **single task**, for more complex tasks like **combat** or **jailbreaks** they may need d6 **favor**s and for longer term tasks like **crafting** or **raids **they may need 2d6 **favor**s. If you can't afford the cost, the contact might ask for something in return, or refuse outright.
| Quality      | Favor Cost | Contact’s Skill |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------------- |
| Adept        | 10s        | 40% +1 Hit      |
| Professional | 100s       | 55% +2 Hits     |
| Master       | 500s       | 70% +3 Hits     |

### Improvement
Contacts can improve over time. Once per session when you use a favor from a contact, there's a **10%** **chance** that they will improve their **Quality** (Adept to Professional, Professional to Master). If a Contact improves, their favor cost increases accordingly.
### Losing Contacts
If they **Fumble** a **Check** for the Player, the contact becomes unavailable for the rest of the session. You may permanently lose a Contact if they feel deeply betrayed by you, suffer a catastrophic loss or die.
### Types of Contacts
Here are some guidelines for different types of contacts you can find:
**Adept Contacts: **They might be apprentices, laborers, shopkeepers, or low-ranking soldiers. They are of **any one Lineage**, have **one Talent **and count as **Tier 3.**
**Professional Contacts: **They might be merchants, skilled artisans, military officers, or local officials. They are of **any one Lineage**,have **three Talents **and count as **Tier 5.**

Combat & Injury
### Rounds & Initiative
Bloodthirsty warriors are circling your flanks, the life-sapper and his demonic allies look on eagerly. At the start of Combat roll **d6.**
On a **1-3** the opponents go first.
On a **4****-6** the party goes first.
**Each Round is ten seconds. **In any order, every combatant on a side may take one **Action** (Attacking, Sprinting (Move at x2 Speed**)**, Casting, Readying an Item, etc…**)** & **Move (**up to your Speed Ability**)**.
### Melee Combat
The sound of steel clashing, the blinding flurry of metal. When attacking while you’re **Engaged**, make a ****Melee** Quarrel**. Your opponent may defend against you with **Melee** or **Light-Foot**.
If your Net Hits are **+0** or more, you **Injure **your opponent.
If your Net Hits are **-1** or **less**, your opponent **Injures** you when using **Melee **or simply dodges the blow when using **Light-Foot**.
### Ranged Combat
The iron arrowhead pierced the flesh, sending a shower of blood over the walls before it slumped to the ground. When attacking while you’re **not** **Engaged**, make a **Ranged Quarrel**. Your opponent may dodge with the **Light-Foot **skill.
If your Net Hits are **+0** or more, you **Injure **your opponent.
If your Net Hits are **-1** or **less**, they dodge.
### Hit Location
A silky, spiked needle pierces your skin, the warped metal tip embedding in your arm. When you strike someone with an attack, the **defender** decides the **hit location**. The **attacker** may** spend** **two Hits** to move the attack one **hit location** away (**Area** or **unspecified** damage always hits the **Torso**).
### Injury
The blade drives deep into their flesh, causing blood to gush from the open wound. Use the following steps when inflicting an injury:
Consult the appropriate **Hit Location** table.
Determine the **Injury Location **using the **Units **die of your attack or roll **d10.**
Determine severity of the** Injury** with your **Net Damage: (Weapon Dmg + Net Hits) - (AV+RB)**.
### Critical Hit
A satisfying Crack sounds as your hammer smashes their skull. If you roll a Critical Hit, use **+6 Hits** as your **rolled Hits** or gain **+1 Hit **for your Check. Also,** increase **the **Injury** you inflict by **d6****E**.
### Fumbles
The cold, spattering mud was everywhere, clinging to your legs like a skin**.** If you roll a Fumble, use **-6 Hits** as the roll for your Check, you also fall Prone**.**
### Battle Wear
Your blade is starting to blunt and your armor is covered in battle scars.
**Increase** the **Damage** of an attack by damaging your weapon by one for +one **Damage**.
**Increase **your **Soak** against an attack by damaging your armor by **one for** +d6 **Soak**.
Advanced Combat
Here are some advanced combat rules, feel free to ignore or rewrite them to suit your game.
### Giving Ground
You dive to the side, narrowly avoiding the crashing axe. After **dodging** an attack, you may give ground to your opponent, this grants you a **+2 Hits** bonus to this **Light-Foot **Check, but you move **ten feet** away from them in the direction of **their choice**. However, if you do this on **two Checks** in a row, you fall Prone.
### Charge
When you charge in a straight line to an opponent & howl a battle cry, you **+2 Hits** to your Attack.
### Brace
When you use an **Action** to take a defensive stance, you gain a ** +2 Hits** to defensive Checks until your next round. However, you **cannot inflict damage**.
### Dual Wield
In a whirl of steel, you savagely cut down your foe. When you wield two weapons simultaneously, you may attack with both by **rolling twice** against a **single defensive roll**, and if your first attack isn’t blocked your second attack is uncontested, but you suffer **-2 Hits** to** both Checks**.
### Mounted Combat

### Fall Damage
The ground drops below your feet, your heart thuds in your chest as you try to comprehend what just happened, but it's too late.

### Alternate Limbs
**Non-living: **Do not suffer Bleed or Pain.
**Wings, Tails, Tentacles, etc: **Use Thigh if it moves you, otherwise use Upper Arm.
Combat Advice
Here’s some general advice for combat & thoughts.
**Quarrel Outside the Box: **You can use **Quarrels **for just about anything if it makes sense. Want to **Grapple**? Great, what do you want it to do? Stop an opponent from moving, pin them prone, or stop them from using a weapon?  You just need to agree to terms and there you go!
**Consistent Quarrels: **Do you want to have something set in stone? Write down the terms of the Quarrel, have the group agree to it and everyone knows what they're in for when it’s used.
### No Hit Points?
Yes, the main point of not having hit points is to keep every attack thematic and meaningful. Ideally I didn't want the game time being spent waiting for something to happen, while keeping things crunchy.
### How To Not Die
When things are looking bad, you probably still have a few options.
**Hit Locations: **The only two** Hit Locations **that can instantly kill you are the Head & Torso. It is in your best interest to take hits to your Arms & Legs. The worst case scenario is lose a limb (every Lineage a **Talent** to get these back) or your opponent moves it to your Torso or Head for a **-2** or **-4 Hit Penalty**!
**Battle Wear:** Armor will save your life, if an injury is that bad consider taking that armor damage, for every one damage you take give you a **d6** extra **Soak** for this attack!
**Giving Ground:** Giving ground grants you **+2 Hits **to your **Light-Foot** Checks for dodging attacks, that’s a big swing in your favor! Just be careful falling prone can be a death sentence.
**Instant Access Concoctions: **This is important for a couple reasons. First, **Conditions** can only kill you at the end of your round. Second, the Concoctions** Scar Serum** & **Venom’s Bane** are common, anyone can buy them & they remove all **Bleed** & **Poison** **Conditions**. Just be prepared for the **Toxicity**.
#### Toxicity
Distilling the *Wicked Winds* into a Concoction is a toxic process. After drinking a Concoction, make an **Imbibe Quarrel** vs the Concotion’s **Toxicity **in **Hits**.
#### Toxicity Quarrels
**Victory: **Concoction is successfully imbibed.
**Victory at a Cost:  **Concoction is imbibed, but you suffer **one Corruption**.
**Failure: **Concoction is rejected, you suffer **one Corruption** and vomit it out.
### Advanced Hit Points
If you would like combat to be closer to standard TTRPGs you can try the **Grit **system:
**Grit:** As long as you have at least one Grit you don’t suffer Injuries. If an Attack would lower your Grit past zero, then you subtract your Grit from the Injury.
**Example:** You have 4 Grit and take 6 Net damage to the Right Arm, your Grit is now 0 and you take a Severity 2 Injury to the Right Arm.
**How Much Grit?**
**Descendants:** Gain either have **Grit** equal to ****Twice**** their **Tier **or ****Twice**** their **LB **(whichever is Higher).
**Monsters:** Gain **Grit **equal to their **HD**.
**How to Recover Grit?**
All **Grit** is recovered from a night’s rest. Additionally if you were to heal from an Alfame, Bleed or Poison and aren’t suffering from that Condition, heal **Twice** that amount in **Grit**.
Magick
When you want to cast a spell, you must draw the raw *Wicked Winds* to your body and channel with your movements. Using an action to **Cast**, roll up to your **Magick** in **d10****E**. If the result is equal to or greater than the spell’s **Cast**ing Hits, your spell is cast successfully.  If the result is less than the spell’s **CH,** you may continue to make **Cast**ing** Check**s in an **E**xtended** Check** (adding the sum of multiple **Cast**ing** Check**s together) until the spell is cast.
### Channeling
You may spend an action to **Channel**, reducing any **Miscast** by a single step.
### Curse of the *Wicked Winds*
You suffer or escalate your **Magick Miscast** by one step, for each **Double** or **eight** rolled. This accumulates until you have cast your spell or ended it prematurely.
**Petty Miscast**
**Great Miscast**
**Cataclysmic Miscast**, adding **+5** to the roll on the table for each **additional step**
### The Apprentice’s Folly
If** a**ll of your dice roll** a** **one, **your spell** a**utomatically fails,** a**nd worse still, you suffer or escalate your **Magick Miscast** by **three **steps.
### A Slow Death
If** **you** **decide** **that** **you** **do** **not** **want** **to** **roll** **your** **Miscast,** **then** **you** **may** **gain** **Corruption** **equal** **to** **double** **the** **steps** **of** **your** **Miscast,** **instead.
### Spellcasting Modifiers
Effects** **that** **would** **hamper** **movement** **(i.e.,** ****Entangled**),** **or** **when** **wearing** **mundane** **armor,** **cause** **you** **to** **roll** ****one** **less** **d10**** **per** **Condition** **and/or** **per** **1** **AV** **of** **the** **most** **armored** **location** **(excluding** **natural** **or** **magick** **armor),** **for** **each** **Casting** **Check.

**Lesser:** An effect that manifests on a small scale or impacts a single target, for example, creating a gentle breeze or summoning a small wild animal like a bird.
**Greater:** An effect that has a substantial impact, often affecting multiple targets or larger areas, for example, summoning a thunderstorm or transforming into a wild animal like a bear.
**Ultimate:** An effect that transcends ordinary limitations, often affecting reality itself or achieving godlike feats, for example, altering the destiny of others, creating new worlds, or even summoning the embodiment of a god.

Magick Miscasts
When you roll a Miscast that includes **Domain** in its description, replace it with one of your Wind’s **Domain**s.
**Example:** a Magick Eruption would erupt with shards of metal for The Gold Wind, or Anguish would rack you with brutal pinpoints of light for The White Wind.

Faith
When you want to enact a miracle, you must verbally request the power of your God and hear their reply. Using an action to **Cast**, roll up to your **Faith** in **d10****E**. If the result is equal to or greater than the spell’s **Cast**ing Hits, your miracle is cast successfully. If the result is less than the miracle’s **CH,** you may continue to make **Cast**ing Checks in an **E**xtended Check (adding the sum of multiple **Cast**ing Checks together) until a miracle is finished.
### Cruel Gods
You suffer or escalate your **Divine Wrath** by one step, for each **Double** rolled. This accumulates until you have cast your spell or ended it prematurely.
**Petty Wrath**
**Great Wrath**
**Cataclysmic Wrath**, adding **+5** to the roll on the table for each **additional step**

Vestments are sacred items or symbols tied to a god’s essence. Your **Faith Score **is capped by the number of visible vestments worn, they cannot be concealed.
1 Vestment allows up to 2 Max Faith
2 Vestments allows up to 4 Max Faith
3 Vestments allows any Max Faith
### Miracle Working Modifiers
Effects that hamper speech or your ability to listen to your god (i.e., Deafened), cause you to roll** one less d10** per Condition, for each Casting Check.
## Spontaneous Miracles
The Gods are not to be trifled with. To create a Spontaneous Miracle, make a single **Casting Check** then consult your Spontaneous Miracle chart for examples of the outcome. For the potency of your effect see the following guidelines:
**Lesser:** An effect that manifests on a small scale or impacts a single target, like Bygorr offering survival advice or Corvis granting good luck.
**Greater:** An effect that has a substantial impact, often affecting multiple targets or larger areas, like Furnos creating a brutal blizzard to ravage your enemies or Dominus rallying and inspiring others to fight.
**Ultimate:** An effect that transcends ordinary limitations, often affecting reality itself or achieving godlike feats, like Minera granting god-like powers of health and healing or Ynir ensuring immense bountiful harvests.
Use your God’s Favored Ability Score's Bonus to determine the potency of its effects.

General Trapping Rules
### Silver Standard
In Witch Iron, silver is the currency of choice, replacing gold in any prewritten adventures. Silver weighs **one encumbrance** for **200 pieces**.
### Weapon & Armor Damage
In the heat of battle, weapons and armor can take a beating.
For each point of damage a weapon takes, its weapon damage (i.e., the **+4** in a Cutlass’s MB **+4**) is reduced by **one.**
The same applies to armor, with armor’s Armor Value (**AV**) reduced by **one** for each point of damage taken.
When a weapon or armor's value reaches **zero**, it is considered **destroyed **and is no longer functional.
### Repairing Weapons & Armor
Damaged weapons and armor can be repaired, but it requires both resources and skill. To fully repair a weapon or armor, make a successful **Trade Check **or it is destroyed in the process. The process of repairing an item takes about **ten minutes**, during which the creature must have access to appropriate tools.
Of course, **Contacts** can be used for this Check.
### Battle Wear
Your blade is starting to blunt and your armor is covered in battle scars.
**Increase** the **Damage** of an attack by damaging your weapon by one for +one **Damage**.
**Increase **your **Soak** against an attack by damaging your armor by **one for** +d6 **Soak**.
### Special Material: Meteoric Iron
Meteoric Iron, a celestial relic, is an indestructible material that originates from the core of fallen stars.
#### How to Find
This rare metal lies in meteor craters, the scars of cosmic collisions. It carries the chill of the void and the searing heat of fallen suns.
#### How to Use
Despite its stubborn nature, Meteoric Iron can be shaped by a master blacksmith into artifacts of unparalleled power and beauty. It** cannot** be **damaged** or **destroyed**, making it an ideal material for crafting weapons and armor that are meant to last. However, its indestructibility also means it** cannot** be used for **Battle Wear**.
### Special Material: Lodestone
Lodestone is a volatile ore with a magnetism that can warp steel, flesh and the *Wicked Winds*.
#### How to Find
Deep underground, Lodestone is mined in veins rich with metal. Those who know its signs can feel its uncanny pull on their mind beneath the earth.
#### How to Use
Lodestone can be used to power a wide array of arcane devices. However, it can also be consumed to enhance one's magical abilities. Consuming Lodestone **doubles** your **Magick** or **Faith Score** for **d6 x 10 minutes**, but you suffer **d6 Corruption**. Furthermore, weapons crafted from Lodestone ignore any **Armor Value**, but you suffer **one Corruption** for each day you had contact with it.
Alchemy
You must be an **Alchemist** to brew **Concoctions**. The brewing process takes the following steps:
#### 1. Gather Ingredients
The required ingredients for one** Concoction** of a given **Tier** and **Essence **are listed. These can be purchased or found.
#### 2. Select Effects
Choose one or more effects based on the ****Tier**** and** Essence** using the provided table as a guide. You must have a ****Tier**** equal to or higher than the ****Tier**** of the selected effect.
Use the **Concoction Tier Examples** table for the strength and type of effects for each **Essence**, Create your own custom effects based on these guidelines.
Use the **General Concoction Effects** table for duration, range, and area of effect, these do not have a **Tier** requirement but add to the **Ingredients** &  **Toxicity**.
#### 3. Concoct
Spend one week concocting per total **Tier** of all effects. The result is a crude Concoction with **Toxicity **equal to the total **Tier** of all effects. Refine the Concoction by making a ****+0%**** **Research Check**, then a ****+0%**** **Trade Check**, reducing **Toxicity **by one per Hit on each Check. (Concoctions weigh **1 Enc**).
#### Toxicity
Distilling the *Wicked Winds* into a Concoction is a toxic process. After drinking a Concoction, make an **Imbibe Quarrel** vs the Concotion’s **Toxicity **in **Hits**.
#### Toxicity Quarrels
**Victory: **Concoction is successfully imbibed.
**Victory at a Cost:  **Concoction is imbibed, but you suffer **one Corruption**.
**Failure: **Concoction is rejected, you suffer **one Corruption** and vomit it out.

Inventing
You must be a **Black-Thumb** to create an **Invention**. The writing process takes the following steps:
| d10 | Invention Quirks                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | This invention is very unreliable,  roll d6, on a 5 or 6 it fails when used.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2   | This invention overheats after use and must cool off for 10 min. If used before that, take one Pain from steam/ sparks.                                                                                                                      |
| 3   | The invention requires 20s worth of fuel or other resources each use or hour of use.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 4   | This invention is overcomplicated, requiring 3 actions to ready a weapon or 2 hours for other inventions.                                                                                                                                    |
| 5   | The invention can be loud and obnoxious. Roll d6 per use or hour of constant use. On a 6, it attracts unwelcome attention from a nearby threat.                                                                                              |
| 6   | The invention is massive! If it would normally be handheld, it is so large that it needs a cart to move it around, or is double its normal size.                                                                                             |
| 7   | The invention requires minor repairs after every use or hour of constant use and does not work until repaired with a +0% Trade Check.                                                                                                        |
| 8   | The invention recoils like a heavy projectile weapon (even if it isn’t a gun). The user is knocked Prone after each use.                                                                                                                     |
| 9   | The invention is so awkwardly shaped or balanced that its user suffers a -20% penalty to any Checks involving the invention.                                                                                                                 |
| 10  | The invention is highly volatile. Roll d10 per use or hour of constant use. On a 10, it self-destructs spectacularly, inflicting d6 dmg per Tier, in a 10ft radius for handheld items, or 2d6 dmg per Tier in a 20ft radius for large items. |

#### Determining Encumbrance
An estimate of the bulkiness and weight of an item:
**Enc 1-2: **A Sidesword or Head
**Enc 3-4:** A Halberd or a Large Shield
**Enc 10+: **A Steam-Assisted Crane
**Enc 20+:** An Auto Grinder
#### Determining Weapon Categories
Weapon categories are designed for a broad range of weapons in a similar theme, such as Yeoman Weapons being practical and easy to use. Using that idea the GM and inventor should agree on the most likely category for a custom built weapon.
Rune Carving
You must be a **Rune-Carver** to create Runes. The carving process takes the following steps:
#### 1. Gather Materials
Runes require 100s worth of the correct gemstone per Tier, and the item you intend to carve it into.
#### 2. Select Effects
Choose one or more effects based on the ****Tier**** and** Essence** using the provided table as a guide. You must have a ****Tier**** equal to or higher than the ****Tier**** of the selected effect.
Use the **Rune Tier Examples** table for the strength and type of effects for each **Essence**, Create your own custom effects based on these guidelines.
Use the **General Rune Effects** table for duration, range, and area of effect, these do not have a **Tier** requirement but add to the **Ingredients** &** Impurity**.
#### 3. Carve
Spend one week concocting per total **Tier** of all effects. The result is a crude Rune with **Impurity **equal to the total **Tier** of all effects. Refine the Rune by making a ****+0%**** **Research Check**, then a ****+0%**** **Trade Check**, reducing **Impurity **by one per Hit on each Check.
#### Impurity
Runes can be physically and mentally draining. After activating a Rune, make an **Hardship Quarrel** vs the Rune’s **Impurity **in **Hits**.
#### Impurity Quarrels
**Victory: **Rune is successfully activated.
**Victory at a Cost:  **Rune is activated, but you suffer **one Corruption**.
**Failure: **Rune is hampered, you suffer **one Corruption** and the activation is delayed by d6 rounds.
#### The Runic Laws
Every Runic item has the following properties:
An item may only have one Rune.
Runes can never be removed.
Items can be damaged but never destroyed.

| Impurity | Additional Ingredient Cost | Duration     | Range              | Area(r) |

### Syrenthal, the Symphony of Souls
-Gain 1 Stage each session you remain connected-
**Stage 1:** Syrenthal begins to manifest, its ethereal notes reverberating with a melody only you can hear. The shard resonates within, its voice a haunting lullaby. You gain the ability to perform a duet with the shard, **doubling** the effects of your songs. However, each performance causes you to suffer **one Stress**, as Syrenthal feeds on your emotional energy.
**Stage 2:** Syrenthal grows in complexity, its form becoming an intricate orchestra of spectral instruments that play on their own. You can now perform a grand symphony with Syrenthal, causing your songs to **affect all** who can hear your music. However, each time you perform a symphony, you suffer** one Stress** and **one Fatigue**, as Syrenthal pulls from your physical energy to resonate further.
**Stage 3:** Syrenthal reaches its full potential, a grand orchestra of ethereal beauty, its music resonating with the Void itself.  The shard’s will merges with your own, granting you the ability to reshape reality through sound. You can perform a solo that physically manipulates the environment within **300 ft**. However, each performance causes you to suffer** d6 Corruption**.
**Examples:**
**Shifting Terrain:** Your melody can dam a river, create a rock wall, or carve through a mountain.
**Weaponizing the Environment:** Your solo sets the trees on your foes, dealing **PB** in** d6** damage.
**Generally:** You can create a ****PB**+2 HD **Monster, deal **PB** in** d6** damage, inflict **PB** Conditions, and use **PB** Hits for** Quarrels**.
Additionally, Syrenthal transforms into a suit of armor made of resonating musical notes. You may not wear any other armor or clothing, but you gain **AV **equal to half of your **PB** + **LB** (rounded down) to all body parts, which fully repairs itself after a night's rest.
You are no longer human, and the** Line of Musicians is at an end.** Only death can cut your connection to the symphony.

In addition, you may inscribe any **Rune** you have a **Pattern** for without a Check that is **one Tier lower **than your own. You can also create a **Pattern** for any rune you inscribe, detailing all of its effects and power.
Finally, after **one week** of inspection, you gain perfect knowledge of any magick item.
#### Scratch Carving

Game Mastering
Game mastering is an art, not a science. It's about facilitating a fun, engaging, and memorable experience for your players.
### My Advice
**Stuations, not Plots:** Your preparation should involve creating a detailed world with various factions, locations, and events, but avoid dictating a specific path for the players to follow. Let their actions guide the narrative.
**Listen: **Pay attention to your players. Their actions and discussions can give you insight into what they're enjoying and want more of.
**Keep Things Moving:** If the game is stalling, don't be afraid to introduce a new element or threat to get things going again.
**Keep things Consistent: **Maintain internal consistency in your world. If something applies in one situation, it should apply in all similar situations unless there's a really good reason.
**Be Fair, But Challenging:** Your role isn't to defeat the players, but to provide challenges.
**Death is a Learning Experience:** Games can be deadly. Don't shy away from this, death should be a learning experience.
**Emergent Narrative: **Stories aren't pre-written; they emerge from the players' actions and the world's reactions to them. Be prepared to adapt and improvise as the game progresses.
### Oracle Roll
Sometimes, you just need to decide a random outcome. I use this the most when I just need an impartial reaction or outcome. You just need to roll 2d6 and consult the following:
**2-3:** Worst Possible Outcome
**4-6: **Negative Outcome
**7-8:** Positive Outcome but…
**9-10: **Positive Outcome
**11-12:** Best Possible Outcome
### Golden Rule
The only rules that matter are the ones in play at your table, when in doubt, come to an agreement. This is just a book not a bible.
### Problems at the Table
Conflicts arise at the table, and that's okay. Most situations just come down to talking with your players. Be open, be respectful, and remember that everyone is there to have fun.
### Ripping Stuff Off
This book was designed with compatibility to OSR content in mind, because I enjoy that content.
**Using OSR Monsters:** Use the Quick OSR Stat Conversion at the back of the book to create a detailed stat block on the fly.
**Taking Monsters for the OSR:** Every monster in this book has a Hit Dice, allowing you quickly convert them into any game that uses similar terminology.
**Using OSR Classes: **This can be more involved than other kinds of conversions. I recommend finding the closest Lineages to this class and using their Talents & Witch Iron Artifacts as a general balancing guide for this new class.
**Taking Lineages for the OSR: **Each Lineage in this book can be converted into a class by using their Talents as class features.
**Using & Taking Effects & Items for the OSR: **Without over complicating things here are some general guidelines for the strength of effects:
| Effect            | Lesser             | Greater             | Ultimate              |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Bonus/ Penalty    | +/- One Hit or 10% | +/- Two Hits or 20% | +/- Three Hits or 30% |
| +/- Condition     | Two Conditions     | Four Conditions     | Six Conditions        |
| Damage            | 3d6 dmg            | 6d6 dmg             | 9d6 dmg               |
| Hits for Quarrels | Two Hits           | Four Hits           | Six Hits              |

Campaign: Factions
Factions are the major powers in your setting. Each faction has its own goals, resources, and strategies. They can be nations, guilds, tribes, or any other group with significant influence.
## Central Conflict
Base *your* factions around a single central conflict, you can of course make up a conflict but I would recommend finding a real historical conflict that you find interesting, then iterate on. The Peloponnesian War is good, but *your* Peloponnesian War is better.
### Player’s Impact
The players are agents of change. They impact factions in one of four different ways:
**Direct Action: **They may directly join the faction on their next action. Instead of rolling the action is played out with the players taking a key point in this action, from this point forward anything goes.
**Supporting Action:** They may go on supporting missions for a faction’s upcoming action. If they are successful the faction rolls an additional** d10** and takes the higher roll. If they dramatically over achieve their goal the faction can roll an additional** 2d10** and take the highest. This cancels out Espionage.
**Subverting Action: **They may go on a mission to subvert a faction’s upcoming action. If they are successful the faction rolls an additional **d10** and takes the lower roll. If they dramatically over achieve their goal the faction can roll an additional 2**d10** and take the lowest. This cancels out Gather Strength.
### Regions
Regions are the geographical areas that factions control. They can be provinces, cities, islands, or any other identifiable locations in your setting. The control of regions is often a major source of conflict between factions.
### Alternate Advancement: Factions
This optional advancement system replaces the standard XP for Silver system. Tiers still give the same benefits and take the same time to advance.
**Earning Faction Points**
-Descendants gain **+1 Faction Point** for joining a faction or notably to help/harm a faction's goals.
-Descendants gain **+2 Faction Points** for major, impactful actions benefiting or damaging a faction.
**Spending Faction Points**

**Advantage: **(First successful assault). You gain the upper hand, pushing the enemy forces back.
**Control: **(Second successful assault). You successfully seize control of their Capital. Your faction's flag flies high.

Faction Creation
Find inspiration based on your central conflict. Try to interlock the faction conflicts as much as you can to create a powder keg of a scenario. A note about Major Goals, in my example I have them build up to a **Tier 15** **Asset**, but feel free to make up your own.
### Lineages
Select or randomly assign 4 to 5 Lineages for that faction, then give them a role in the faction. This has two benefits for your scenario. Firstly it gives your factions themes to inspire further aspects of the faction. Secondly, it places these Lineages in the world for your players to interact with & unlock.

Their seasonal gatherings—under the solstice sun or the harvest moon—are marked by feasts, storytelling, and rituals to honor the spirits of the land. Each tribe maintains its autonomy but pledges to uphold the sacred tenets of The Pact. While some permanent settlements are carved into cliffsides or built from living wood, the majority of their people live in nomadic camps that adapt to the shifting needs of the land. These camps blend practicality with reverence, serving as sanctuaries for ritual, council, and preparation for war, while leaving little trace of their presence.

**The Shadow’s Embrace **(*Knighthood Vigils*): Initiates undergo a night-long trial in the Château’s labyrinth, hunted by veteran Shadows, to prove their cunning and resolve.
### Major Goal: The Whispering Wind
The Échelon’s **Tier 15** Asset: The Whispering Wind is a grand plot, a network of agents, misinformation, and strategic magicks designed to sow chaos among Échelon’s enemies, ensuring their dominance.
**Obstacles:**
**The Traitor’s Gambit **(*Benedict Arnold’s Treason*): An Échelon agent betrays the Whispering Wind's structure to the Crown. The Échelon must eliminate the defector before enemy factions exploit the intelligence.
**The Ciphered Codex **(*Rosetta Stone*): A critical cipher that holds the key to Échelon’s hidden messages falls into enemy hands. A rival Échelon group secretly orchestrated its theft, aiming to shift power dynamics within the faction. The betrayal must be uncovered, adding internal tension as leaders question their allies' loyalty.

# The Reavers
Inspired by Barbary Pirates & Hessian Mercenaries
### Lineages of the Guardians
Berserker, Warden, Flesh Sculptor, Ordained
**Berserker:** Fearless shock troops who lead brutal boarding actions and land assaults, their battle cries echoing like storm winds.
**Warden:** Skilled trackers and monster hunters, adept at navigating treacherous terrain and taming the wilderness.
**Flesh Sculptors: **Field surgeons and grotesque experimenters, ensuring the survival and enhancement of their warriors.
**Ordained:** Spiritual leaders who blend maritime lore with fiery sermons, keeping morale high and justifying their brutal actions.
### Culture
The Reavers embody a volatile fusion of pragmatic discipline and chaotic freedom. The mercenaries among their ranks bring a rigid hierarchy, valuing contracts and precise execution, while the pirate traditions emphasize wild feasts, unpredictable raids, and fierce individuality. This duality creates a unique tension: the mercenary’s calculated professionalism often clashes with the pirate’s appetite for risk and plunder. Rituals like the Salt Oath bridge this divide, demanding loyalty to the crew above all else, binding even the most unruly to a shared purpose.
### Laws
**The Salt Oath** (*Barbary Treaties*): Contracts are sacred. Breaking one results in immediate death by drowning, a sacrifice to the sea gods.
**Chains or Death** (*Hessian Recruitment*): Captured enemies are given a choice—join the Reavers or face immediate execution.
**Sanctioned Raiding** (*Barbary Corsair Licensing*): Raids must be sanctioned by the Reaver Council. Unauthorized attacks invite brutal retribution.

**The Branding Ceremony** (*Hessian Enlistment*): New recruits are branded with the Reaver sigil to signify loyalty and discourage betrayal.

**Obstacles:**
**The** **Monster’s** **Maw** ****(*Capture** **of** **Algiers*):** **A** **hidden** **cove** **shelters** **a** **colossal** **sea** **beast** **whose** **flesh** **is** **key** **to** **creating** **the** **giants.** **The** **Reavers** **must** **lead** **an** **expedition** **to** **capture** **or** **kill** **it,** **navigating** **not** **only** **the** **creature’s** **wrath** **but** **also** **rival** **factions** **racing** **to** **claim** **its** **power.
**The Defector’s Gold **(*Arnold’s Treason*): A rogue Flesh Sculptor offers their knowledge to a rival faction. Recovering their research—or silencing them—requires dangerous negotiations or a daring infiltration.
**The Siren’s Debt **(*Barbary Slave Trade*): The Reavers owe an enormous debt to a powerful sea witch, who demands tribute in the form of captives or priceless relics. Refusing her demands risks losing her support—and her curse.
**The Soul’s Edge **(*The Ethics of War*): The transformation into giants strips warriors of their humanity, leaving them brutal and unrecognizable. Some Reaver leaders question if such a price is too high. The Reavers must decide whether to press forward or explore alternative solutions, risking division within their ranks.
### Internal Conflict
**Freebooters vs. Mercenaries **(*Barbary Pirate Alliances*): Independent captains, or Freebooters, resent the increasing control of the Reaver Council, sparking skirmishes over autonomy and allegiance.
**Faith vs. Flesh **(*Hessian Religious Struggles*): Ordained leaders like Seeress Riptide denounce the Flesh Sculpting labs as blasphemous. Some go further, organizing clandestine operations to sabotage the facilities and halt the Horde’s creation.
**Legacy vs. Profit **(*Hessian Loyalty Debates*): Veteran Reavers demand honor-bound loyalty to longstanding allies, but younger captains prioritize lucrative contracts, risking betrayal of sacred oaths for gold.

Campaign: The Dark Descent
Your lineage is cursed by a demon, each with unique powers and goals. The demon seeks to corrupt your lineage for its own ends, and each generation can learn a part of the demon's **True Name**. The ultimate goal is to serve or defeat the demon.
### Why?
The demon aims to use your lineage as pawns in its struggle against other dark gods. It seeks to gain access to the mortal realm through your lineage.
### The Exchange
Players can choose to use The Exchange to **Reroll any Check**, but it comes at a cost. You will not be able to use the exchange again until you roll on your **Demonic Influence table**.
### Naming the Beast
Each generation, players can go to the edges of sanity and overcome challenges to gain a part of the demon's true name. The challenges are based on the type of demon the Descendant has chosen. If you’re successful, roll on your **True Name **table & **Demonic Trait** table tied to that word. Each generation can gain one part of the demon’s name.
### Channel the Name
If a descendant knows a part of the demon’s true name, they can channel the demon for special abilities based on the type of demon it is. Each word of the demon's true name is tied to one of the demon’s powers, and these powers can be used by making a **Quarrel** against **one Hit** per **Word known**, or roll on your **Demonic Influence** table.
**—--------------------------------------------****Demons are Lesser Gods trying to overthrow a current god. Cult creation/use. Miracles/ Godstains, target gods to overthrow. Replace characters gaining traits with God-Stains.**
### Damnation
Damnation comes in two forms: losing one's mind or body to corruption or madness, or becoming an abomination. The **Abomination** transformation is a powerful form granted by the demon, offering a boost of short-term power but at the cost of the descendant's soul. You may transform at any time, this is irreversible, and the descendant is damned forever. As an abomination, you become a monster with **HD** equal to **Twice** your **Tier** and lose all **Lineage Talents **&** Skill Specializations**. However you keep all **Mutations, Madnesses, Wind-Scars & God-Stains**, while **Doubling** their **Bonuses**. If a descendant is damned, they can be used by the demon beyond their natural lifespan.
### The Ultimate Outcome
The lineage is doomed to serve the dark gods or to truly defeat the demon by learning its true name and gaining control over it. Once your line has learned **all eight parts of the demon's true name**, you may shout its full name, summoning the demon to overcome it directly. This will be a battle between the Descendant and the demon, the outcome of which will determine the fate of the lineage.
There are two ways this battle can happen:
The demon will claim the line if **eight of the descendants are corrupted**. Manifesting itself to directly claim the last descendant. If the demon wins, the line is damned, but if you defeat it, your line’s fate is delayed until the next descendant falls to the darkness.
You may choose to fight the demon using the true name, if you win, the line dominates the demon, gaining full access to its powers and never having to roll on the **Demonic Influence** table again. If the descendant loses, they become damned.
The end result will depend on the choices the Descendant makes throughout the game.
The Bloody Axe

Monster Qualities
The following are  general Qualities which may be applied to any monster, as needed.
### **(Scale) Mob**
This is a group of monsters and not an individual, gaining the highest benefit from the following table.
| Mob Scale | Number of Bodies | Mob Attack |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Small     | 5+ Bodies        | 2          |
| Medium    | 20+ Bodies       | 3          |
| Large     | 50+ Bodies       | 4          |
| Huge      | 100+ Bodies      | 5          |

Mobs also follow these special rules.
**Bodies: **Mobs do not suffer **Injuries**. They instead lose **one body **for every **5 dmg** suffered.
****Mob Attack**:** When attacking, a mob rolls an additional attack for each **Mob Attack**, and if an attack isn’t blocked, all following attacks are uncontested (similar to Dual Wielding).
**Area Attacks:** If this attack kills at least **one body**, the mob will lose **d6** **extra**** bodies** per 5 ft radius (i.e. 10 ft radius kills 2**d6** **extra**** bodies**).
**Losses: **A Mob’s scale is reduced when its **Bodies** are **equal to **a **lower **scale value (i.e. small at 5 bodies) & the Mob / nearby Leader must pass a +0% Steel / Leadership Check or rout.
